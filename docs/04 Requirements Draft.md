## 🚀 MVP Requirements

- [ ] **R1: Schedule add** A user should be able to add a course to a candidate schedule.
	- [ ] **R1-1** As a user, I don't want to accidentally add a course that conflicts with my current classes. I should be prevented from doing this (unless I know better, in which case I should be able to manually override).
		- NOTE: An example of this would be adding Concert Choir for audit and another ("conflicting") class on Fridays at 4 - I will still be able to take this class and just miss Fridays and I want my scheduling app to reflect that reality
- [ ] **R2: Schedule removal** As a user, I should be able to remove courses from my candidate schedule from the search view or from a list of my classes
- [ ] **R3: Robust Search** As a user, I should be able to search for a class by its course code or keywords
	- [ ] **R3-1** As a user, I should be able to filter by classes that fit in my current schedule for a given semester (current, i.e. add/drop OR future, i.e. "next semester").
	- [ ] **R3-2** As a user, I should be able to search for a professor and see classes that are taught by that professor
	- [ ] **R3-3** As a user, I should be able to explore a department's offerings
	- [ ] **R3-4** As a user, I should be able to filter credit hours based on a range that I define
- [ ] **R4: Calendar view/schedule overview** As a user, I should be able to navigate to a calendar which shows all of my currently scheduled classes. I should be able to click on these classes for more information.
	- [ ] **R4-1** As a user, I want to see some insights, like how many total credits I'm taking
- [ ] **R5: Data persistence** As a user, my classes should be available to me, even if I exit the web page. It should save my classes.
- [ ] R6:
